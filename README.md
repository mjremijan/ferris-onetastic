Microsoft OneNote Onetastic macros

## About

I created this as an edited version of the Onetastic yearly calendar macro. I found the one they provide is very good, however, I wanted some customizations. These are my customizations.

The source code is the Onetastic XML representation of the macro. I've found it easy enought to copy & paste this XML into Onetastic when creating a new macro.

## Creating my yearly calendar macro

These are the general steps for creating a new macro for my yearly calendar.

1. **XML source code.** Go to the GitHub project (https://github.com/mjremijan/ferris-onetastic) and copy the RAW XML of the macro.
1. **New Macro.** Click the "New Macro" button on the ribbon
1. **Paste XML.** Select "Function > Edit XML" from the window menu. Paste the XML. Click the "OK" button. Once the edit XML dialog box goes away, you will see the source code of the macro in the Macro Editor window.
1. **Save.** Click the little save floppy disk icon on the toolbar. A Macro Info dialog will appear. Add the following info:
* **Name:** My Yearly Calendar
* **Category:** Calendar
* **Description:** My customized yearly calendar.
1. **Close.** Close the Macro Editor window
