Microsoft OneNote Onetastic macros

## About

I created this as an edited version of the Onetastic yearly calendar macro. I found the one they provide is very good, however, I wanted some customizations. These are my customizations.

The source code is the Onetastic XML representation of the macro. I've found it easy enought to copy & paste this XML into Onetastic when creating a new macro.
