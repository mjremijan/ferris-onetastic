Microsoft OneNote Onetastic macros

## About

I created this as an edited version of the Onetastic yearly calendar macro. I found the one they provide is very good, however, I wanted some customizations. These are my customizations.

The source code is the Onetastic XML representation of the macro. I've found it easy enought to copy & paste this XML into Onetastic when creating a new macro.

## Creating my yearly calendar macro

These are the general steps for creating a new macro for my yearly calendar.

1. **XML source code.** Go to the GitHub project (https://github.com/mjremijan/ferris-onetastic) and copy the RAW XML of the macro.
